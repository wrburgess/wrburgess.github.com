title: Quicker Title/Link Copy & Paste in Chrome
---

I tend to like grabbing Page titles and links from webpages for referencing them in blog posts later on. However, it usually requires a two-step process of doing the copy+paste on each string and flipping between the browser and text editor to get it done.

I found a new Chrome Extension called **Create Link** that lets you take care of this multi-click process in the formatting of your choice (I like to use Markdown).

## Installation/Configure

1. Visit the [Create Link extension page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/create-link/gcmghdmnkfdbncmnmlkkglmnnhagajbm?hl=en) and install
3. Click on the **Create Link button** (top-right of your browser) and select *Configure*
4. Review the default Formats: *Plain text*, *HTML*, *mediaWiki*
5. In my case, I added Markdown with ```[%text%](%url%)```
6. If you added a format, restart your browser

## Usage

1. Find a page, select the title or text, right-click
2. Select the format of your choice
3. Paste in your text editor

Done!
