After [Posterous decided to call it quits](http://technorati.com/social-media/article/twitter-to-close-posterous-less-than/), and while having little-to-no faith that Tumblr will keep the lights on long-term, I decided to build up a new wrburgess.com site utilizing [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and [Github](http://www.github.com).  

So far, so good. I'm going to see if I can find a way to remotely publish items like I did with Posterous/Tumblr, so all my pics of fancy food and cats should start showing up soon.
